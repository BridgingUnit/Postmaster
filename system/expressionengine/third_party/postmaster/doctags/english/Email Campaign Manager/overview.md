## Email Campaign Manager

### Problem

Email campaign integration is a common request among clients. There are a lot of different add-ons that do various things, all in their own unique ways. This forces people into a box. Clients that use one add-ons (or service) may get things that aren't provided in another. More add-ons means more code to support and more things that are likely to fail when you upgrade.

### Solution

Postmaster provides a suite of utilities that help you and your client manage their email lists that isn't dependent on any one service. Postmaster takes a different approach by basing everything on an API that standardizes these requests. You can use the same tag to subscribe users to MailChimp and CampaignMonitor.

### Features

1. Compatible with MailChimp and CampaignMonitor
2. Standardized and memorable API
3. Stand-alone entry forms (SAEF) with inline error handling
4. Easy to implement with AJAX

*We are constantly adding features and compatibility with new services. If the email service you use isn't available, let us know. We implement services based on popular demand.*
