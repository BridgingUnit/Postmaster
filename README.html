Postmaster
E-mail Notifications for ExpressionEngine


Email Notifications
-------------------

Send transactional based emails when a member creates or edits a channel entry. Define an number of parameters to determine when to send each email including channel, status, member group, categories, or custom conditional. Emails can be post dated or even setup them up to be reoccuring. Postmaster is highly configure and tries to impose as few limits as possible.

* CRON jobs must be configured separately.


Email Marketing
---------------

In addition to transactional emails, Postmaster can be used to create and send email campaigns. It's all about the experience for the client, and the fewer sites they have to login and interact with, the faster they get things done with the least likelihood of errors. Use the familiar publish entries screen and your own preferred custom fields to draft and send campaigns. Bottom line, your client never has to worry about an email template. Postmaster makes this entire process familiar and incredibly simple. 


Email Services
--------------

Unlike other add-ons, Postmaster doesn't limit developers and their clients to any one email service. Postmaster supports a variety of email services including MailChimp, CampaignMonitor, SendGrid, Postmark, and more*. There is a full featured API available for developers to integrate their own services.

* Email services are not required. Sending emails using CodeIgniter is available.


Real-time Previews
------------------

In our experience building email templates can be a real pain, and Postmaster attempts to makes life a lot easier. Use a powerful code editor to quick create templates that can be previewed in real-time preview. Your ExpressionEngine tags, HTML, and CSS are instantly rendered that allow you to build emails and templates in a way you never have before. The entire process was designed to help developers create gorgeous templates in a fraction of the time, which is a win for both developers and clients.


Event Delegation
-----------------

Postmaster was designed to not just send emails, but as a unified API that can be extended for more advanced event delegation. For example, you use MailChimp to send email campaigns. But what about email subscription forms, unsubscribe, and get subscribers, or any of the other API end points? What if one client uses MailChimp, but another uses CampaignMonitor? Why should you have to use two different add-ons, with two different sets of capabilities, problems, and challenges. Postmaster introduces *delegates*.

So what are delegates? Delegates allow developers to create custom tags. For instance the same tag is used to subscribe users to MailChimp as it with CampaignMonitor. Developers can create tags to do anything they desire using the Event Delegation API.
