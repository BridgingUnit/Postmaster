- Refactored API again to be more consistent. Services now extends Base_service instead of Postmaster_core. Postmaster_core is a core class in which all base classes are extended.
- Any service or hook you have created should be updated to extend Postmaster_base_class if it extends Postmaster_core.
- All API's have an install, update, and uninstall routines that are triggered when the respected method are triggered within Postmaster
- All API's have a pre_process, post_process, trigger, and send
- All API's should extend Postmaster_base_class, not Postmaster_core
